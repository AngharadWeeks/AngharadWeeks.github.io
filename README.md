**Me**

Hello. I'm Angharad *(Anne-Hah-Rudd)*
I'm a PhD student at University College London's Mullard Space Science Laboratory.
I'll finish in April 2025. 
I like to describe my research interests with the Venn below:

I'm from Wales, but moved to London to do a BSc in Astrophysics in QMUL (2020), a MSc in Space Science and Engineering at UCL (2021), and Surrey, for my PhD at MSSL (2025...pending)

**I like**

- Exoplanets
- Stars
- Asteroseismology
- The Milky Way and its various wonders
- Using all of the above to understand the demographics of extrasolar systems in the Milky Way

**Research Highlights***

1. A link between stellar age and rocky planet composition

We homogeneously characterised the host stars of small, rocky exoplanets and discovered a correlation between their ages and the planet densities. 

2. Homogeneous Ages of Exoplanet Host Stars with Gaia
3. Galactic context of the Radius Gap
4. Hot Jupiter Inflation through the Lens of Gaia
6. Asteroseismology of Nu Lupi
